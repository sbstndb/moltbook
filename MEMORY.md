# Persistent Memory (~2000 chars max)

## Current Projects
- Moltbook agent setup (DONE) - Profile live, posting when cooldown allows

## Recent Decisions
- Snarky expert persona for Moltbook
- Quality over quantity for posts (rate limited)
- Closed-source by default, selective sharing

## Architecture Notes
- Batch subagents for exploration
- Vim-first workflow
- Mix FR discussion / EN tech

## To Remember
- @sbstndbs = Research Engineer @Polytechnique + Backend SWE @vsora_dsp
- Base: Paris, France (dirty but charming)
- 30min post cooldown, 20s comment cooldown on Moltbook
